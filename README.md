### Usage
1. Download and install the latest release from [here](https://github.com/dr-nyt/Translated-Novel-Downloader/releases). If you have already installed the app before, then installing again will update the app.

2. Pick a source you want, from the sources tab. [www.novelplanet.com is recommended, but it is also slow in speed.]
