## CONTRIBUTE

Contributing to this project is very straight forward. This is a step-by-step guide on how to add a source to the app.

**Before getting started there are a few things that you need to be aware of:**

-   You must have a good understanding of HTML, CSS & Javascript. Knowing how to scrape websites is a plus.
-   You must also know how github works. I recommend using the [Github Desktop]() app for beginners.
-   This app is built on [Electron]() and [Angular](). These are javascript frameworks.
-   This app uses typescript, which is a superset of javascript.  
    If you have a good understanding of javascript than this shouldn't be an issue. I recommend watching this [short video on typescript]().
-   If you get stuck, feel free to ping me on [discord]().

### Prerequisites

-   Install [NodeJS]().
-   Check the [Issues]() section on github to see if the source you want to add is requested.  
    If it is, then leave a comment stating that you will work on this source.  
    Otherwise, [create a new issue]() and state which source you will be working on.
-   Fork this repository on [github](https://github.com/HanaDigital/NovelScraper).
-   [OPTIONAL] I recommend using [VSCode]() as your IDE.  
    If you use VScode, I suggest using the following extensions:

    -   [Angular Essentials (Version 9)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.angular-essentials)
    -   [Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-highlight)

-   Clone the forked repository on your machine, and open a terminal at that location.
-   Run the following command to install all the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
-   After all the dependencies install correctly, you can run the following to start the app in dev mode:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

_When in dev mode, the app will use a new dev library instead of the normal library_

---

### Add the Source

**We will assume we are adding the source [boxnovel.com]() to show the process**

-   Create a 150x150 png image for the source and save it in this directory `src/assets/img/sources/`.  
    Boxnovel does not have a logo, so I used its initial letter to create a logo `src/assets/img/sources/boxnovel-logo.png`.  
    Here are a few examples:

<p align="center">
	<img width="200" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41040912/95757580-600e5580-0cb8-11eb-9ee9-36500f3b94a5.png">
  	<img width="200" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41040912/95757581-613f8280-0cb8-11eb-9488-9efb6997b86d.png">
	<img width="200" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41040912/95757585-61d81900-0cb8-11eb-94f8-b1eaa8b7c1c5.png">
  	<img width="200" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41040912/95757582-613f8280-0cb8-11eb-9753-d9b9a76f1aeb.png">
</p>

-   To add your source to the sourceList, open `src/app/resources/sourceList.ts` and add this line.

    ```typescript
    export const sources: sourcesList = [
    	{ name: "ReadLightNovel", link: "https://www.readlightnovel.org", icon: "assets/img/sources/readlightnovel-logo.png" },
    	...,
    	/////////////////////////////////////////  THIS LINE  ///////////////////////////////////////////
    	{ name: "BoxNovel", link: "https://boxnovel.com", icon: "assets/img/sources/boxnovel-logo.png" },
    	/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    ];
    ```

    -   `name`: Name of the source with every initial letter capitalized.
    -   `link`: Link to the source website. Make sure the link does not end with the `/` character.
    -   `icon`: This is the path to the icon you just added. The path will always start with `assets/img/sources/`.

-   So far so good, the source should now appear in the sources page of the app!

### Create the Source Service

_The Source Service will handle how to scrape the novels from a source._

-   To create the service for a source we will run the following in the terminal.  
    _Note, you will only change the last part of this command and the name of the source needs to be lowercase_  
    In my case, I will run:

    ```javascript
    ng g s services/sources/boxnovel
    ```

    This will create a new file in `src/app/services/sources/` called `boxnovel.service.ts`.

-   Now we need to let the app know that this new service exists.  
    Open `src/app/services/sources/source-service-manager.service.ts`.
    -   Import the service you just created at the top of the file. In my case, I will import:
    ```typescript
    import { BoxnovelService } from "./boxnovel.service";
    ```
    -   Add the import to the construct of the class so it can access it:
    ```javascript
    constructor(..., public boxnovelService: BoxnovelService) { }
    ```
    -   In the `getService()` function, add an `else if()` statement for your source:  
        _Note, the `sourceName` must match the source name you added in the `sourceList`._
        In my case I will add:
        ```typescript
        getService(sourceName: string): sourceService {
        	...
        	...
        	else if (sourceName === "ReadLightNovel") return this.readlightnovelService;
        	/////////////////////////////////////////  THIS LINE  ///////////////////////////////////////////
        	else if(sourceName === "BoxNovel") return this.boxnovelService;
        	/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
        	else return undefined;
        }
        ```
-   Now the app should be able to recognize the source service you created.

---

### Implement the Source Service

-   Open the source service you created. In my case: `src/app/services/sources/boxnovel.service.ts`
-   Add these imports to the top of the file:
    ```typescript
    import { chapterObj, novelObj } from "app/resources/types";
    import { DatabaseService } from "../database.service";
    import { NovelFactoryService } from "../novel-factory.service";
    import { sourceService } from "./sourceService";
    ```
-   You need to extend this class to gain more functionality:
    ```typescript
    export class BoxnovelService extends sourceService {
    ```
-   Change the constructor of the class so it looks like this:
    ```javascript
    constructor(public database: DatabaseService, public novelFactory: NovelFactoryService) {
    	super(database);
    }
    ```
