2. Launch "run.py".
   - This file will automatically install the required dependencies and run the app.
3. Paste the link of the novel you want [eg: https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-god-asura]
   - If you want to download all the volumes then leave the volume box empty in the GUI.
   - If you want a specific volume, then type in the volume number you want.
   - You can optionally add a cover page for every volume by saving an image in the rsc/ folder and then typing the name of the cover image in the cover box of the GUI. [eg: mga.jpg]
4. Click compile to let it rip! [The files will be compiled in a way that makes them easily convertable to .epub files]
5. You can install [calibre] from "https://calibre-ebook.com/download" to easily convert them to .epub files. [It is recommend that you convert them to epub for the best experience.]

### TO-DO

### Notes
This is just a programme I made for fun and would love for your input,
so feel free to report any issues and I'm open to anyone who wants to improve the code :)
Also this is just educational, and I dont support piracy, nor am I responsible for anything you do with this.
